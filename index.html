  <p>🧿Just because we don't talk anymore doesn't mean that I've forgotten about you🥺. It doesn't mean that I no longer care because the truth is I still do🫶. I find myself doing my best to check up on you to see how you're doing☺️ but every time I get the urge to talk to you it suddenly hits me that we are strangers now🥹. Even though everything changed, I want you to know that I am still here😶‍🌫️, I'll still be here for you, I'll still lend you my shoulder and my ear 😇and I don't care what time it is, I don't care what I am doing because half🤭 the time I wish that you were talking to me. There will always be a place in my heart that still hurts😟 whenever I think of you. A part of me will always be waiting for you🥺........🫶</p>

  <p>👀I know I hurt u🥲 and keep saying I love u not perfect but 😶‍🌫️I make mistakes but that's no excuse✨. I know the pain ur getting from me, I try to make u happy but ☺️ seems like other people make u perfectly happy than me who's trying. I sometimes feel like you want someone who's perfect but u tend to prove me wrong sometimes...😀 As I feel the tear go down my cheek, I noticed that my heart is weak to carry the load I had done in the past with u. I feel guilty 🙁and I have to say sorry🫶 to u, and I want you to always smile😀. Don't fade your smile for the mistakes I made. Let the rest stay in the past, and make a special smile on your special day, because you are special and irreplaceable💓. You've filled a space no one else can🤌 and I hope you understand that my love for you won't fade anytime soon.</p>
