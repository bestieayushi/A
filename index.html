<p> 🧿Just because we don't talk anymore doesn't mean that I've forgotten about you🥺.
  It doesn't mean that I no longer care because the truth is I still do🫶.
  I find myself doing my best to check up on you to see how you're doing☺️ 
  but every time I get the urge to talk to you it suddenly hits me that we
  are stranger now🥹. Even though now. Even though everything changed I want
  you to know that I am still here😶‍🌫️, I still be here for you, I'll still lend
  you my shoulder and my ear 😇and i don't care what time it is, I don't care what I am doing because
  half🤭 the time i wish that you were talking to me. There will always be a place in my heart that
  still hurts😟. Whenever I think of you. I think a part of me will always
waiting for you🥺........🫶</p>
